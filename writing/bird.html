                    I can't feel anything. Everyone is walking by me, ever so often taking a glance, and either showing a face of pity or disgust. I wonder what the tall ones think when they see my body; there must be a moment of sadness followed by the reminder of acceptance that 'we eat animals and they aren't conciounensus like us'. I don't look that bad honestly I've seen worse, some of us go out in a disgusting way, and in public for all to see. Honestly, I don't mind being here on the sidewalk, it makes me feel seen, even though I am dead. All my life has been the same, it was so simple; eat or be eaten, hide, gather, and hunt. Now that I've passed to other side I don't feel the need to do those things anymore. Although I can't fly I can still see. I see a short one with long hair approach my corpse. I know corpse is a little dramatic for being hit by a car windshield and not being able to breathe then slowly becoming dead, but I am going to use corpse because that it is what I feel like. It seems to be studying me and attempting to understand why or how I died. I can't move or make a sound, I can't fly anymore, but honestly who cares. This new life of mine, or the end of my primate life, is mesmerizing. Why do they keep walking by me, what do they think, why did it take my death for me to realize all that is around me isnt a battle of survival.

                    It feels like I have been laying here for half a day now, the sun is setting behind tall buildings. I'm not used to this view, I've always been above in the air only limited by the wind and my endurance. I never really thought of what it was like for other ones to be always on the ground; I guess their world is similar to mine and perhaps when they pass away they will too see what I see. I've never noticed how beautiful the sky was, even when I've spent my entire life in it, it feels as if I am looking at it for the first time. How do clouds support themselves in the sky, and why do they not have wings like me. How many colors exist around me and how can I see them all. I feel like a newborn, like I am young again, not as a survivor, but as an observer. I do not know what parts of myself work and what has been ruined, I do know my eyes are allowing me to see the physical world around me, and something behind or around them, is allowing me to understand its presence. The only feeling I feel is curiosity, everything else does't exist. The bottom of the world is as beautiful as the top, it is not dark here anymore but vibrant with machine lights and small antena ones running about. The sky is a light pink and the clouds are maintaining their space. Buildings patrode from the ground stabbing the sky but never coming in contact with it. Machines run through the streets controlled by random movements, sometimes coming in contact with each other, sometimes stopping with tall ones leaving them.  I remember being on those buildings, and not noticing any of these things before, I am saddened by not taking advantage of the gift I had before, but I understand my motives and appreciate my new perspective.

                    It has become night and I haven't moved since my accident this morning. I don't know what fate awaits me, but seeing what I see now, it seems like more than I know is possible. None of it makes sense to me but I seem to be welcoming it with an open mind, I believe fear left me after I passed away. Upon impact it seemed like the world around me was coming to an end. It still feels like that, but since I am already dead, I have nothing else to fear. I don't know if another one will come to me, or if my body will deterioate and my eyes with it; whatever happens to me, will happen. I am not afraid and I love every second I have to look at my world from below.

                    Everyone around me is dying, they will all come to an end. The small antena ones, who have been scuring around me, for some reason avoiding my body, are living as I was; surviving. To them tomorrow doesn't exist and the entirety of their actions are instincual, how I was living everyday without a second thought about the sky or beauty around me. I will call the small ones that survive like me, instinctuals, for obvious reasons.
